                        My passion for solving problems was apparent since my high school times, even though they were just the academic ones then. After completing my undergrad in Computer Engineering from Mumbai (India) I started to work as a Software Developer at Infosys. At work, I was always complimented for being able to look at a bigger picture, a skill that I guess I picked up in my very first project. Later I joined JP Morgan, where while working in a fast-paced environment I found it exciting to analyze the problems, get to the root cause and provide solutions. I always ensured I understood the problem right and found better ways to solve them. Additionally, I learned to collaborate with multiple people - product managers, testers, salespeople and other developers.

                        Often at work, I was appreciated having strong attention to detail but it was only last year while helping a friend on his start-up, I discovered my interest in creating engaging, delightful and seamless experiences for the people to reach their goals. It was the first time I came across the term - User Experience (UX) and I started to read more about it and took a few online courses. Thereafter I decided to go to school and dive deeper into the field of Human-Computer Interaction.

                        Through all this, I’ve realized that my passion for design stems from a desire to make a lasting and profound positive impact. As a student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, I am taught not only how to build a product for the user, but also how to analyze its intersections with society and the environment. It's a complicated world out there, which I would love to simplify.
